## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* **Python:** 3.8+ recommended
* **Required Libraries:** (List the libraries used in your project in `requirements.txt` and briefly mention key ones below)
    * `llama-cpp-python` (or other model loading/inference libraries like `transformers`)
    * Other necessary libraries (e.g., `streamlit`, `flask` if using a UI)
* **Llama 3.2 1B Model:** Model file in GGUF format (assuming usage of llama-cpp-python)
* **Hardware:**
    * A reasonably modern CPU
    * Sufficient RAM (e.g., 8GB+ recommended, depends on the model size)
    * (Optional) Compatible GPU and CUDA/ROCm setup for GPU acceleration (depends on llama-cpp-python setup)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Hi_LLM_Chat.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Hi_LLM_Chat.git)  # Change YourUsername to your actual GitHub username
    cd Hi_LLM_Chat
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # You need to create this requirements.txt file
    ```
    * If you need GPU support for `llama-cpp-python`, refer to its documentation for specific build/installation options.

4.  **Download the Llama 3.2 1B Model:**
    * Download the **Llama 3.2 1B model file in GGUF format** from a trusted source like the Hugging Face Hub. (e.g., `llama-3.2-1b.Q4_K_M.gguf`)
    * Place the downloaded model file into a designated folder within the project (e.g., `./models`).
    * **Note:** Please check and comply with the model's license agreement.

5.  **(If Necessary) Update Configuration:**
    * Check within the code (e.g., in `config.py` or the main script) to ensure the path to your downloaded model file is correctly specified. Modify if needed.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py  # or the actual name of your execution script
    ```
2.  Once the chatbot is running, type your message into the prompt and press Enter.
3.  Watch as the chatbot's response is generated and displayed in a streaming fashion.

## üß† Model Information

* **Base Model:** Meta's Llama 3.2 (1B parameter version)
* **Format:** GGUF (compatible with llama-cpp-python)
* **Source:** Hugging Face Hub, etc. (Compliance with model license is mandatory)

## üîß Configuration (Optional)

You can adjust parameters like the model path, generation settings (temperature, top_p, etc.), max tokens, etc., within the code. (Add specific details on how to configure here)
